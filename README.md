# CodeSupport API

## About
This repository contains the code for the CodeSupport API. The project is written in TypeScript using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework with a postgreSQL database.

## **Getting started**

The project uses a `.env` file for configuration. Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. If you're going to run the application in docker, no changes to the configuration are required. If running without docker, change the settings to match your own environment.

### **With Docker**
For development purposes, this project is configured to make use of Docker for easily running the API and a local postgresql instance with no configuration required. In order to make use of this, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) must be installed on the machine. The easiest way to get these components on MacOS, Windows and Linux is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

With docker installed, the application can be started by running the *start:docker* npm script with no further configuration required.

`npm run start:docker`

This will automatically set up docker images for postgresql and the NestJS API with hot reloading, meaning the docker container will automatically update when a file is changed.

If any NPM dependencies are installed or uninstalled, docker might not pick up the changes to the NPM dependencies. To fix this, run `docker:rebuild`. This will rebuild the image and refresh any cached NPM packages.

### **Without Docker**
The application can also be ran without Docker. In this case, Node.js version 12 or later (tested with 16.13) and a PostgreSQL server instance is required. Make sure you've set the correct settings in the `.env` file, then start the app by running the `start:debug` script.

`npm run start:debug`

### **Attaching a debugger**
### Visual Studio Code
With both the docker and non-docker approach, the application is automatically set to debug mode. If you're using visual studio code, you can easily attach a debugger by going to the 'Run and Debug' tab and selecting either the `debug-docker` or `debug-local` profile.

## Creating migrations/seeds
### Migrations
Creating a new migration can be done by running the following command `docker compose exec api npm run migration:create -- [name]`.
There are a few requirements before this can be done. First being that both the database and api container are running. And that the `ssynchronize` option is turned to false in the typeorm config, this can be done by adding `NODE_ENV=testing` in the `.env` file.
Lastly the database should only be filled with tables generated by migrations. To active this use the following commands to get a clean database up. `docker compose down postgres`, `docker volume prune` and `docker compose up`. Now the migrations can be run in order to have the database up to the latest version.

To run migrations make sure both the api and database containers are up, then run the following command: `docker compose exec api npm run migration:run`.

### Seeds
In order to generate a seed file run `npm run seed:create -- [name]`. This will create a file in `/src/seeds` named `time-[name].ts`. Note: Typeorm doesn't automaticly captilize the name, make sure you do this in the command.
If you want to run the migrations run the following command: `docker compose exec api npm run seed:run`.
